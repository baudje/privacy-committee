# Welcome to the Privacy, Security, and Transparency Committee
 
We are an [Open Mobility Foundation](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/) committee tasked with advising the Foundation on principles and practices that ensure the secure handling of mobility data. 

To that end, we seek to bring together our members and engage subject matter experts so that we can develop these practices openly and collaboratively. Although voting membership in the committee is limited to OMF member organizations, we invite and encourage participation from anyone.

## Contributing

Join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/openmobilityfoundation.org/forum/#!forum/privcomm/join) if you'd like to contribute to our work and/or attend our monthly meetings. You'll also need to agree to our [contributor license agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification?redirect=true).

We meet on a monthly basis in an open forum. Refer to the [OMF Public Calendar](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/wiki#omf-public-calendar) for details on our upcoming meetings.

## Current Work

Per our charter, 

> The Privacy, Security and Transparency committee will review and develop policy for appropriate transparency and data protection measures such as privacy, data retention and anonymization features, as well as technical security practices related to urban mobility data including but not limited to encryption, role-based access control, and penetration testing.  These policies shall support responsible and trustworthy data management practices that serve individual privacy, security, transparency and safety.

In the near term, our work focuses on three deliverables:

1. [Inventory of the State of Practice](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/privacy-committee/wiki/Mobility-Data-Management-State-of-Practice) [Complete]

We built a catalog of current principles, policies, methods, and technologies applicable to location data privacy and anonymization.

2. [MDS Privacy Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JvVSWw1-VwFdYqQIefvKvM0RmfEK2tv1wTyjeyNUavY/edit?usp=sharing)

The MDS Privacy Guide is intended to help cities responsibly adopt MDS by laying out the considerations and best practices related to MDS data and personal privacy. The current draft was authored by the voting membership of the OMF's Privacy, Security, and Transparency Committee. We are currently accepting feeback, [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqIeUarDh4NEgfWnbs8l0AAKdSUGeq0QnFx91Cly7WmdQgdg/viewform).

3. Privacy Principles

We are developing a set of principles to guide the OMF as it develops tools and technologies, and to articulate the common ground among public- and private-sector users of mobility data about the need to respect and protect individual privacy.
